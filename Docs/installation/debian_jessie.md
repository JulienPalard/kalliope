```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git python-pip python-dev libsmpeg0 libttspico-utils libsmpeg0 flac dialog libffi-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev portaudio19-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev sox libatlas3-base mplayer

## Test your env

To ensure that you can record your voice, run the following command to capture audio input from your microphone
```
rec test.wav
```

Press CTRL-C after capturing a sample of your voice.

Then play the recorded audio file
```
mplayer test.wav
```

If everything is ok, you can start playing with Kalliope. First, take a look to the [default settings](../settings.md).
